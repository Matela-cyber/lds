              Mathe's research interest lies in the area of Information and
              Communication Technologies for Development, also known as "ICT4D".
              This field in essence deals with the questions of how ICTs (i.e.
              digital technologies) may be used "for good" to advance human
              development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mathe will be highly valuable to the Digital Innovators Summit due
              to their strong academic background in digital technologies and
              their applications, as well as ensuring that the summit's
              discussions consider diverse and marginalized communities,
              promoting inclusivity in the African context.

              With creative roots set in storytelling in its various
              expressions, her work is grounded in critical literacies spanning
              across history, media and arts curriculum and pedagogy. Segoete's
              practice revolves around cultural production and the cultivation
              of creative heritage through collaborations with other academics
              and artists.

              Her background in media and arts, as well as her expertise in
              storytelling, critical literacies and cultural production are
              essential to the Digital Innovators Summit, as she will contribute
              insight into the cultural and artistic implications of
              misinformation and malinformation.

              With an academic career grounded in chemical sciences and emerging
              technologies—including computational techniques in studying
              complex analytical data—Professor George has played a leading role
              in building research ecosystems that respond to Africa's
              socio-economic challenges. His leadership has nurtured home-grown
              academic excellence and fostered regional collaborations aimed at
              leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for sustainable
              development. Renowned for integrating research, policy, and
              community engagement, he serves as a vital link between academia
              and national innovation systems. His presence at the Digital
              Innovators Summit highlights the critical role of higher education
              in shaping Africa's future in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              At #DIS2025, Professor George will speak on "AI Talent and the
              Role of Higher Education," a theme deeply aligned with his
              scholarly and institutional mission. He will share insights on how
              universities can drive digital fluency, build research capacity,
              and cultivate entrepreneurial thinking among young Africans. As
              the continent navigates rapid technological shifts and the demand
              for inclusive growth, his perspective will spark dialogue on
              curriculum reform, innovation ecosystems, and multi-sectoral
              collaboration. In an era where AI is redefining every aspect of
              life, Professor George's voice is both timely and
              transformative—championing a digital future that is intellectually
              grounded, locally relevant, and globally competitive.
